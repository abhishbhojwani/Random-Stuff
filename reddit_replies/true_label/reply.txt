I'm still not sure what you are asking, so I'll just walk through what I *think*
you are trying to do.

From the code you posted you have a tkinter application that accepts a string
that you want to search for.  When the user presses a button you perform the
search and the result of your search ('True' or 'False') is displayed in a
label.

It is not clear what you search when the button is pressed, so I'll write a
function that takes a search string and returns a random True/False answer.
This simulates your search and makes it easier for you to change the code to
do a real search.

    import random
    def my_search(search_string):
        """Change the code here to do an actual search."""
		if random.random() < 0.5:
			return False
		return True

When the application is being used, this is what happens:

* The user types a search string into the 'Textfield' Entry window
* The user presses the 'Button1' search button
* The search string is passed to the search function
* The search function returns True or False
* A string 'True' or 'False' replaces the 'Label1' text

The first bit of code you need to add is the code that handles the button
press.  When you create the button you must also use a 'command' option that
joins the button to some code that is called when the button is pressed:

    def button_press():
        """The user pressed a button."""
        
        search_string = Textfield.get()
        print('search: %s' % search_string)
    
    ...
    
    Button1 = Button(window, text="Search", command=button_press)

Put the above code into your program and try it.

Once you have the search string you can see if the search string exists
somewhere.  Do this by calling the 'my_search' function to get a True/False
value.  Then you need to convert the True/False value into a string and
finally update the label text.  The updated 'button_press' function would
look something like this:

    def button_press():
        """The user pressed a button."""
    
        # get search string and look for it
        search_string = Textfield.get()
        result = my_search(search_string)
    
        # convert True/False result into a string
        result_str = str(result)
    
        # put 'result_str' into the label text
        Label1.config(text=result_str)
 
I'll discuss **what** you search in another post.
