You haven't explained just **what** you are searching.  The string the user enters
in the 'Textfield' is what you are searching **for** but I don't know **what**
you are searching.

Your code example has this line:

    Listexample = 'STEAM_0:0:187162090 STEAM_0:0:18714757 STEAM_0:0:1897544' # example of a list

This appears to contain some kind of Steam ID information.  If you are searching
a 'list' for things like this then you need to show where you get it from and
what format the data is.  Maybe you are given a file to search, maybe you get
it from the internet.

As a simple example, I'll show how to search for types of animals:

    # the animal 'database'
    Animals = [
               'cat',
               'dog',
               'mouse',
               'python',
               'hamster'
              ]
    
    def my_search(search_string):
        """Search for 'search_string' in Animals.
    
        Returns True if 'search_string' was found.
        """
    
        lower_str = search_string.lower()  # ensure the search string is lowercase
        if lower_str in Animals:
            return True
        return False
