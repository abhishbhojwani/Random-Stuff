I saw your posts on a bunch of programming subreddits so I thought I could
approach you for some guidance.

I was just bored looking around online for coding challenges to prepare me for
next year (I'm a high school student) and I came across Shopify's intern
challenge (https://backend-challenge-winter-2017.herokuapp.com).

I consider myself good at programming and Python with past internship
experience. I consider myself to be decent at DS and algos. That being said, I
was completely stumped by this intern challenge - I don't even know where to
start or what it's asking for.

Do you think you'd be able to just give me a direction of where to go? Or what
skills I should know to approach this problem?

The window for summer internships closed so I'm just trying to learn here. I
find doing Leetcode manageable, but coding challenges like this that involve
IRL situations difficult...
