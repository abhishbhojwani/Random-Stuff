The simplest approach to a GUI for your game is to have:

* a "Play" Button to signal the start of a game
* a widget to display the results of each guess
* an Entry in which the user types her guess
* a "Guess" Button which the user presses when each guess is ready

That last button is the important one.  If the user is guessing "15"
then you really DON'T want the user typing the initial "1" to be
mistaken for a new guess.  So you need another button to tell your code
that a new guess is ready.

You don't need to use lambdas to tie a button to some code to handle the
button press.  Just do:

    Button(frame, text="Play!", command=self.play)

and

    Button(frame, text="Guess", command=self.guess)

There are ways (I think) to have only one button, but these require your
code to remember what "state" it is in, and I think when starting GUI
programming it's best to stay simple.
