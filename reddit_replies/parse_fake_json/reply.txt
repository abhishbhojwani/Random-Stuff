I tried fiddling with the input data to make it JSON, but found that to be a
losing game.

The other approach is to just parse the data into a list of dictionary strings
and *eval()* each string.  It's up to you to decide if you can trust the input
data enough to do that!  Of course, this approach is incredibly brittle.  And
it only works for python2 (suffix L problem).

    import sys
    
    # the test data
    Data = "[{u'id': 234207492300014L, u'name': u'General:'}, {u'id': 141253567024793L, u'name': u'Misc'}]"
    print('Data=%s' % Data)
    
    # parse the list of dicts
    x = Data.strip()				# paranoid enough?
    x = Data.replace(', {', '|{')   # or some other delimiter that WON'T appear in Data
    print('x=%s' % x)
    if x[0] != '[' or x[-1] != ']':
        print('ERROR: badly formed data')
        sys.exit(10)
    x = x[1:-1]
    
    # split into list of dictionaries
    y = x.split('|')A				# delimiter we inserted above
    print('y=%s' % str(y))
    
    # eval each dictionary string
    for d in y:
        print('d=%s' % d)
        z = eval(d)
        print('\t.id=%s' % z['id'])
        print('\t.name=%s' % z['name'])
