backup
======

This program has been used since about 2004.  It is used to backup
a selection of directories to an external hard drive.  Some of its
features are:

* the target external drive must be mounted and correct
* target backups are saved in a timestamped directory
* use the rsync "link to old backup" feature to save space and time
* performs a target filesystem check if requested
