The script here is used to backup my NOTEBOOK, which is a
`TiddlyWiki <http://tiddlywiki.com/>`_ application I keep on a USB memory
stick.  The script backs the stick up into a dated directory in a known
location, does a check on the integrity of the filesystem on the stick
and also limits the total size of the known location directory.
