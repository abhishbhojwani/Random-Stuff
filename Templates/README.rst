Here are some simple templates to use when starting a program.

We have examples for a C and python program as well as GUI templates for
Tkinter, wxPython and PyQt5.

Also here is **dummy.c** which is an old version  of **template_cli.c**.
Note the reference to *__BORLAND_C__* which shows how old dummy.c is.
I probably wrote this file back in the 1990s!
