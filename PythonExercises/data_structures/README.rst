What is this?
=============

The set of directories here each contain a tutorial on some simple data
structure written in python.  Programmers whose first language is python
may not get exposed to data structures at the implementation level and probably
won't understand some of the nuances of the structures.

This sort of thing isn't seen much as python has such good built-in data
structures.  The tutorials therefore should be good at instructing in how
some data structures can be implemented in pure python as well as showing
how APIs are designed and demonstrating test-driven-development.
