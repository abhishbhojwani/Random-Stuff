I have decide that when my next iThing needs replacement I will look beyond
Apple.

At the moment I have:

* A 13" MacBook Pro retina
* An iPad Air
* An iPhone 6
* An iPod Touch 4th generation
* An iPod Nano 6th generation

I'm not one of the blind Apple fan-boys.  I was aware I was buying into a
culture that tried to lock me into a walled-garden.  I've been using and
working with computers since 1977.  I write software for Windows, Linux as
well as Mac.  I have another laptop that dual-boots Windows 7 and XUbuntu.
I thought I could handle the lock-in tendency.  So why have I decided to turn
away from Apple?

I grew tired of the perceived attitude of "we know best" and the inscrutable
face Apple presents to the world.  Apple is successful, no doubt about that,
but that was due to one person: Steve Jobs.  Does Apple have what it takes
to continue producing "insanely great" products without him?  Let me give you
a few examples.

I have no complaints about my iPod Nano.  Probably because I don't use it.

Instead I use an iPod Touch.  It's a good piece of kit and
has lasted well.  Before that I had one of the last hard-disk video iPods.
Well, I actually owned three.  The first one lasted two weeks before dying
when it was plugged into a USB port.  Apple immediately replaced it, no
questions asked.  The replacement lasted two **hours** before dying the same
way.  Apple again replaced it.  I decided that if plugging the thing into a
USB port was dangerous then I would do that infrequently.  I updated the
music on it once and it lasted for years.  So I think Apple service, in this
instance, was first rate.

My complaint since then is the entire system surrounding music on my iPod
Touch.  iTunes is the absolute worst piece of software I use, whether on
Windows, Linux, OSX or iOS.  If I try to put new music on my iPod I first have
to figure out how in the hell to get iTunes to do that, with it's interminable
backing up and me never being sure what is going to happen.  Once past that
hurdle I end up with my music on the iPod but not really usable as the wonderful
software has decided to 'organize' my music.  I end up with the first movement
of a symphony followed by something unrelated.  This is so bad I have written
software to fiddle with the ID3 tags on all my music files so I can predict
where the hell my pieces go.  It's not pretty or perfect, but it's better
than iTunes.

Apple might well say that their software is designed to help inexperienced
users and not to allow experienced users do whatever odd thing they may want,
but that's the challenge of great software - to allow beginners to "get things
done" without making experienced users want to poke an eye out.  Looks like
that's too hard for Apple.

I bought the first iPad sight unseen.  I thought it was the best thing since
sliced bread.  I still think so despite time moving on and making it too slow
for much beyond reading books.  I upgraded to the iPad Air.  The retina screen
is *excellent*.  The reduction in escutcheon width along the long sides was a
backward step in usability.  Yes, it *looks* prettier, but it makes using the
damned thing harder.  Apple is actually saying that the iPad should be used
only in landscape mode, not portrait.  Strange, because the retina iPad has
so many pixels that it can reasonably used in portrait mode.  It is so
infuriating when, for the umpteenth time, my right palm touches the screen
just a little forcing a change in YouTube video.  This is so bad that it's
the prime reason why I will look elsewhere when the time comes to replace
the Air.

On to my iPhone 6.  I though I would try Apple after a less than satisfying
experience with a couple of other 'phones.  It really is a good piece of kit
but the "Apple knows best" shows through here too.

I often browse the 'net in bed.  Anyone who does this knows that you want to
lock the screen so that when you roll onto your side the screen stays put
rather than switching display modes.  Anyone remember when Apple thought you
didn't a screen lock and had to retro-fit it?  Well, they still haven't got
it right, as you can only lock the display orientation into portrait.  That's
right, even though iOS on the iPad can lock in either orientation and even
though an iOS application works in landscape orientation, Apple has decided
that you don't *really* need to lock the display in landscape orientation,
despite there being a lot fewer pixels in screen width with portrait.  For me,
this is a deal breaker.  I write software for a living and I fail to comprehend
how *anyone* can think not providing landscape lock is anything but a fail.

And now the MacBook Pro.  It too is a good piece of hardware.  The software is
a little strange.  Apple has its way of doing things, for sure, but whoever
though that displaying a new window the user just caused to be raised **behind**
other windows was a good idea?  Things like that and the apparently decreasing
stability of OSX leads me to look elsewhere.  Apple has spoiled me for hardware
quality so I have to find that sort of quality along with a high resolution
screen.  Maybe I'll try installing Linux on it.  Battery life may suffer, but
if it means less aggravation, bring it on.

On the plus side, my rMBP has decided to have battery problems.  I'll be
without it for four weeks while Apple does whatever it does, at a cost of
about AUD$400.  Gives me a chance to get reacquainted with my Windows/XUbuntu
laptop.

But it also reminds me that I have become trapped in the walled garden as my
rMBP time machine backup isn't accessible from Win/Linux.  Also, my external
disk containing my music was reformatted a while back to use the Apple
filesystem and isn't safely accessible from Linux.  The external disk *used*
to be ExFat format so I could access it from both Mac, Windows and Linux, but
I had so many problems with OSX reporting uncorrectable errors (which Windows
fixed in a trice) that I moved to the Apple filesystem.  Which solved my
persistent filesystem errors but trapped me just a little more in the walled
garden.

Trouble is, Android isn't a slam dunk certainty either.  One thing Apple does
well is to keep iThings updated constantly.  Well, sometimes there's a little
glitch, but Apple is still ahead of the curve here as most Android manufacturers
drop there device like a hot rock after you buy it.

Pity Apple doesn't make insanely great hardware *and* software anymore.
