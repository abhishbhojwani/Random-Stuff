What is this?
=============

This is a little exploration of how simply the primitives of Lisp may be
implemented in Python.  The use of functions to represent data is a little
mind-bending, in a good way!

The file **lisp.py** contains the cons/car/cdr code and some helper functions.

The file **test_lisp.py** tests the above implementation.

I may have run across this in SICP_ but I can't remember..
