Big City Skyline
================

This was the first Google Code Jam problem I attempted a *long* time ago.  I
have fond memories of this problem, and still feel proud that I got it to run
within the memory and time limits **with python**.

I should have my original attempt somewhere on backup, but I will attempt it
again here.

Since we have no given test data and time/memory limits, we create a program
to generate test data of configurable size.  See **make_data.py**.

This problem is quite simply stated.  The first question we have is "how do we
solve this?".
