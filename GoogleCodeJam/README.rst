I have found the early
`Google Code Jam <https://code.google.com/codejam/contests.html>`_ problems to
be very good at making you think and sweat, particularly those that have time
and memory constraints.

Here are some of the puzzles I've tried.

**NOTE: You should attempt the puzzles before reading the code here.  You will
learn much more that way.  Plus you may find a better solution than mine!  If
you do, please let me know.**

In each directory here there is one problem from the Code Jam practice page.
Included is something that might be useful - a **Discussion** file that
contains design thoughts, trade-offs taken, dead-ends hit, etc.  This sort
of thing is rarely seen in the normal repository but may be useful for those
new to *exploratory* programming.  This will be embarrassing as I will **not**
go back and edit the discussion, so my mistakes will be apparent to all the
world.  We all make mistakes, the trick is to find them early and correct them.

In each puzzle directory there is a complete problem definition (in README.rst)
as well as the two test datasets Google provides.  I do this as over time the
Google practice pages tend to disappear and I want to keep the connection
between the puzzle, code and test data.
