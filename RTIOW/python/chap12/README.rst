The program here is from Chapter 12 of "Ray Tracing in one Weekend"
by Peter Shirley.

I had problems in *chap09* getting the python to produce the same results
as the C++ code.  After much thrashing around, I decided to work backwards
and convert the final C++ code to python and then simplify to chap11, etc.
