Ray Tracing in One Week
=======================

The python code here is inspired by the C++ code in the book "Ray Tracing in One
Weekend".

I (re)discovered the fact that PPM graphics files are simple text files.

The code here was written to experiment with this:

write_PPM.py

Writes a simple PPM file showing gradations of colour.
