genppwd is a program to GENerate Pronouncable PassWorDs (geddit?).

The basic idea is to produce a stream of consonant+vowel pairs, truncate to
the desired length and then perhaps randomly perturb some alphas to uppercase
and also some alphas to numerics.

We don't put special characters into the resultant password (yet?).
