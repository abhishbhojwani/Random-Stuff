Why write this?
===============

I wrote this when replying to the umpteenth "What language should I learn?"
post.  My posts to that sort of question were inevitably long screeds, so I
wrote this document which will get referenced in any future posts of mine.

If I had posted something different to each "how do I ..." post, each post
would just have been a collection of quick half-formed thoughts.  At least this
way I will finally have a collection of **considered** half-formed thoughts!

Programming is not about the language, it's about you
-----------------------------------------------------

When I was at university trying to learn how to be a programmer it was clear
that there were three types of students:

1. Those who would never be good even though they studied hard
2. The average students who learnt a bit but were still average
3. Those who were going to be good despite being at university

You need to be something like type 3 if you have any hope of learning to be a
programmer **by yourself**.  How do you become type 3?  I don't know.  Certainly
curiosity is part of a good programmer.  Patience and lack of patience, at the
appropriate time, is another.  Larry Wall has a
`great quote <http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LazinessImpatienceHubris>`_ along these
lines.

The type 3 students were the ones who worked late hours trying things out,
trying a different approach or algorithm.  Because there might be a better way.

To learn to be a programmer by yourself you have to become what I call a
"hacker".  The modern definition of the word "hacker" is rather negative.  The
`older definition <http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker.html>`_
describes the good programmer personality.  I would add to that definition
the attributes of curiosity and inventiveness.  You should always try for an
acceptable on-time solution, but always be thinking about better solutions,
easier long-term maintenance, more adaptable code, etc.

A computer language is just the basic tool used to tell a computer what to do.
You have to know what to do first, before you tell the computer!  And that's
**really** what being a programmer is all about.

Paradigms, database, network, gui, ...
--------------------------------------

There's a lot more to programming than the language you use.  Being able to use
a particular language well is just the very beginning.  If you want to solve
problems (which is what a computer is used for) then you need to get into
a myriad other things, such as databases, GUI libraries, data structures, etc.
While I don't agree with everything said,
`this overview <http://www.wikihow.com/Become-a-Programmer>`_ might be useful.

There are different paradigms in languages, such as procedural programming,
object-oriented programming, functional programming and logic programming.
There are many other words used, many marketing driven.  You should get exposed
to them all, or at least a large subset.  This is why I like python for
beginners: it's simple to start but you can get into some really advanced usage
when you are ready.  Ruby is probably like that, but I don't really know.

Operating system
----------------

In the beginning it really doesn't matter what operating system you use.  Later,
though, it's important that you get exposed to the three big OSs: Windows, OSX
and Linux.  OSX and Linux are sort of the same, but Windows is very different.
If you can, start learning on both Windows and Linux.  If you don't want to
spend money, learn on Linux.  You really need Apple hardware to run OSX, but you
don't need to *learn* on OSX, so leave that OS until you need that platform.

Resources
---------

You will use a lot of online resources while learning and when a working
programmer.  So an internet connection is required.  Not necessarily a reliable
connection while *learning*, but when working you need a reliable connection.
`Google <https://www.google.com>`_ is your friend!
Or `DuckDuckGo <https://duckduckgo.com/>`_, etc.

When you get some experience try to help others in your language or framework
of choice.  You don't really know something until you've tried to teach someone
else, and that's when your own learning accelerates!

GitHub
------

While I'm not a great fan of `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_
you should create an account and develop any code you write in it.  For better
or worse it's a good place to show your portfolio of code.  People can look at
the quality and how often you update.  Plus it's a good way to backup your code
and get experience using a distributed version control system and an issues
tracker.  There are other, similar, repositories, but GitHub is the
`800 pound gorilla <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/800-pound_gorilla>`_
at the moment.

Broadening experience
---------------------

When you know one language reasonably well you should try another, different,
language.  Even the best language constrains the way you think about and solve a
problem, so exposing yourself to a very different language helps to broaden your
view.  Languages like C, python, Java, Forth or even an assembly language are
useful in this respect.  I would even go so far as to recommend installing
Scheme and plowing through the first few chapters of
`SICP <https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/>`_.  The
`videos <http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/>`_
are also good value.  You will be exposed to a very different approach to
problem solving.

Side projects
-------------

You won't get anywhere if all you do is follow an online tutorial and do the
exercises.  Even if it's a really good tutorial.  You have to take a solution
(yours, or the tutorial one if one is given) and try to critique the code.  Is
that a good way?  Could it be more readable?  Would a different algorithm be
faster or more clear?  Try to solve a more generalised problem than that given
in the tutorial.  I have found the early
`Google Code Jam <https://code.google.com/codejam>`_ problems to be very good at
making you think and sweat, particularly those that have time and memory
constraints.  There are other sites that have problems you can try.

Even better, after getting your first solution try to solve the exercise again
in a different language.  That's a really good way to learn your second
language!

You must write code to learn to program, and then analyse the code, tear it
apart and rewrite it.  Get your hands dirty.  It also helps if you read other
people's code.  Be critical if the code can be improved, and steal ideas if
the code is better than you would have written.

There is no better way to learn than by solving your own problems.  Have a
problem with iTunes mangling your playlists?  Write some code that creates
playlists the way you want them.  It's time to change passwords for the hundred
or so sites you use?  Write a little program to generate strong memorable
passwords that you will use, with configurable lengths and characters used.
Solving your own personal problems makes your learning more interesting, you
get closer to real-world programming and you get pushed into areas you might
not have been before.

Communication
-------------

It's important that you can communicate freely and well.  Even if you are a
native English speaker you need to work on your presentation.  If you are not
a native speaker then you have to do even more work.

When you work with programming languages you have to be very precise, and this
carries over into the written English language.
`This <http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#skills4>`_ explains why
good English is important.

For example, I wrote the first draught of this in vim into a text file.  But I
copied it into OpenOffice so I could spell-check it before I committed it.  I
hope that all my mistakes were caught, but probably not. [#]_

This applies even to the code you write.  You spent a lot of time and effort on
your code, didn't you?  So why doesn't it look like it?  The first edition of
`SICP <https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/>`_ has this quote:

    Programs must be written for people to read,
    and only incidentally for machines to execute. 

Summary
-------

After all that, I haven't yet answered the original question:

    What language should I learn first?

I hope you can see now that your first language doesn't really matter as you
will go on to learn many others if you become a working programmer.  However,
the way to knowledge can be smoother if you choose a language that doesn't
clutter your path with initially unnecessary complications.  You are really
learning how to solve problems with a computer.  The language is incidental.

Python is a good first language, as is Ruby.  Either of those will help you get
started by teaching you the fundamentals.  If you are going to learn by yourself
look at the support communities for your language of choice, on-line tutorials,
etc.

If you start with another language that's fine.  Just be sure to expose yourself
to other languages later.  If you don't get some exposure to other ideas and
approaches you can get a distorted view of what is possible in any solution you
write.  Paul Graham talked about this in his essay
`Beating the Averages <http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html>`_ in the section
*The Blub Paradox*.

My Recommendation for a First Language
--------------------------------------

After saying above that the first language you learn doesn't really matter, I'm
going to go ahead and put in a recommendation for a first language.  Why would I
do that?

Some people just need a shove to get going.  They won't just pick a language and
start, so I recommend one that I think is useful as a training language.

Most programmers of my era often started with something like BASIC on an 8-bit
microcomputer.  This brain-damaging experience didn't seem to put many off then,
and that leads many to assume that Basic (or Java, or C++) is fine to start with
now.  I disagree.

Modern computer languages are *much* more complicated now than they were.  I
remember taking
`Kernighan & Ritchie <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)#K.26R_C>`_
home one Friday night and starting to write moderately complicated C code on
Monday.  That's a lot harder to do now when every language comes with an IDE and
massive library.  Why burden beginners with all the minutiae of modern languages
when they don't even know what a **while** loop is?

Better to start simple and progress into more complicated things later.  Start
with procedural programming, learn about loops, functions and all that.  Then
advanced data structures, external to the language if possible.  It's better to
write your own code to handle linked lists, for example, because when you get
to a language that has them built in or provided by a library you actually know
what is going on and why some things are slow and others are fast.

And that means starting with a language with a language with a
`REPL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop>`_.
It's simpler to do that than start talking about files and editors and make and
compilers and linkers and whatever.  Using a heavyweight IDE like VisualStudio
or Eclipse is not correct at the beginning either.  Yes, they *help* the student
but that's because the student really needs help with the massive language
structure.

So my recommended starting language is: **python**.  Yes, I am bigoted, but I
accept that other languages like Ruby may be just as good.   Javascript, in my
opinion, is unnecessarily hard for beginners with too many special cases
and `wat! <https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat>`_ moments.

Python is a relatively simple language to start with, but it is powerful.  Much
of that power is hidden away but is available when you need it.

Python has too many good data structures built-in to be a *really* good teaching
language. [#]_  To learn the bones of linked lists and hash tables you 
really should implement them in something like C or assembler.  You can
implement them in python, of course, but most students aren't shown that. [#]_

So python is simple.  But that doesn't mean it's limiting like other simple
languages such as Basic.  With python you also have a pretty good
object-oriented environment.  You just aren't forced to use it as you are with
Java.  The language also has limited functional programming features.

Once you can handle all that python itself offers there is a large library of
built-in modules that allow you to do just about anything you want to do.  And
after that there is the even larger library of modules in
`the CheeseShop <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_.

Good luck!
