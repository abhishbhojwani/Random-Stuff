I wrote this when replying to the umpteenth "What language should I learn"
post.

Programming is not about the language
-------------------------------------

When I was at university trying to learn how to be a programmer it was clear
that there were three types of students:

1. Those who would never be good even though they studied hard
2. The average students who learnt a bit but were average
3. Those who were going to be good despite being at university

You need to be something like type 3 above if you have any hope of doing this
yourself.  How do you become type 3?  I don't know.  Certainly curiosity is part
of a good programmer.  Patience and lack of patience, at the appropriate time,
is another.  `Larry Wall <http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LazinessImpatienceHubris>`_
has a great quote along these lines.

The type 3 students were the ones who worked late hours trying things out,
trying a different approach or algorithm.  Because there might be a better way.

To learn to be a programmer by yourself you have to become what I call a
"hacker".  The modern definition of the word "hacker" is rather negative.  The
`older definition <http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#what_is>`_
is what you should aim at.  I would add to that definition
the attributes of curiosity and inventiveness.  You should always try for an
acceptable on-time solution but always be thinking about better solutions,
easier long-term maintenance, more adaptable code, etc.

A computer language is just the basic tool used to tell a computer what to do.
You have to know what to do first, then tell the computer!

Paradigms, database, network, gui, ...
--------------------------------------

There's a lot more to programming than the language you use.  Being able to use
a particular language well is just the very beginning.  If you want to solve
problems (which is really what a computer is used for) then you need to get into
a myriad other things, such as databases, GUI libraries, etc.  While I don't
agree with everything said, `this overview <http://www.wikihow.com/Become-a-Programmer>`_
might be useful.

There are different paradigms in languages, such as procedural programming,
object-oriented programming, functional programming and logic programming.
There are many other words used, many marketing driven.  You should get exposed
to them all, or at least a large subset.  This is why I like Python for
beginners: it's simple to start but you can get into some really advanced usage
when you are ready.  Ruby is probably like that, but I don't really know.

Operating system
----------------

In the beginning it really doesn't matter what operating system you use.  Later,
though, it's important that you get exposed to the big three OSs: Windows, OSX
and Linux.  OSX and Linux are sort of the same, but Windows is very different.
If you can, start learning on both Windows and Linux.  If you don't want to
spend money, learn on Linux.  You really need Apple hardware to run OSX, but you
don't need to learn on OSX, so leave that until you need that platform.

Resources
---------

You will use a lot of online resources while learning and when a working
programmer.  So an internet connection is required.  Not necessarily a reliable
connection while _learning_, but when working you need a reliable connection.

When you get some experience try to help others in your language or framework
of choice.  You don't really know something until you've tried to teach someone
else, and that's when your own learning accelerates!

GitHub
------

While I'm not a great fan of `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_
you should create an account and develop
any code you write in it.  For better or worse it's a good place to show your
portfolio of code.  People can look at the quality and how often you update.
Plus it's a good way to backup your code and get experience using a distributed
version control system and an issues tracker.  There are other, similar,
repositories, but GitHub is the 800 pound gorilla at the moment.

Broadening experience
---------------------

When you know one language reasonably well you should try another DIFFERENT
language.  Even the best language constrains the way you think and solve a
problem, so exposing yourself to a very different language helps to broaden your
view.  Languages like C, Python, Java, Forth or even an assembly language are
useful in this respect.  I would even go so far as to recommend installing
Scheme and plowing through the first few chapters of `SICP <https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/>`_.
You will be
exposed to a very different approach to problem solving.

Side projects
-------------

You won't get anywhere if all you do is follow an online tutorial and do the
exercises.  Even if it a really good tutorial.  You have to take a solution
(yours, or the tutorial one if one is given) and try to critique the code: is
that a good way?  Could it be more readable?  Would a different algorithm be faster or
more clear?  Try to solve a more generalised problem than that given in the
tutorial.  I have found that the early `Google Code Jam <https://code.google.com/codejam>`_
problems to be very
good at making you sweat, particularly those that have time and memory
constraints.  There are other sites that have problems you can try.

Even better, try to solve the exercise in a different language.  That's a really
good way to learn your second language!

You must write code to learn to program, and then analyse the code, tear it
apart and rewrite it.  Get your hands dirty.

Communication
-------------

It's important that you can communicate freely and well.  Even if you are a
native English speaker you need to work on your presentation.  If you are not
a native speaker then you have to do even more work.

When you work with programming languages you have to be very precise, and this
carries over into the written English language.
`This <http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#skills4>`_
explains why good English is important.

For example, I wrote the first draught of this in vim into a text file.  But I
copied it into OpenOffice so I could spell-check it before I committed it.  I
hope that all my mistakes were caught, but alas, probably not.

Summary
-------

After all that, I haven't yet answered the original question:

    What language should I learn first?

I hope you can see now that your first language doesn't really matter as you
will go on to learn many others if you become a working programmer.  However,
the way to knowledge can be smoother if you choose a language that doesn't
clutter your path with unnecessary complications.  You are really learning how
to solve problems with a computer.  The language is incidental.

Ruby is a good first language, as is Python.  Either of those will help you get
started.  If you are going to learn by yourself look at the support communities
for your language of choice, on-line tutorials, etc.

Good luck!
